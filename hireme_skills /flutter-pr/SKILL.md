## Branch Name

Use conventional format:

```
fix/<short-description>
feat/<short-description>
refactor/<short-description>
perf/<short-description>
chore/<short-description>
```

Keep it lowercase, hyphen-separated, concise. Example: `feat/company-chat-unread-badge`

## Commit Message

Follow conventional commit format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>

<optional body — explain why, not what>
```

- Types: `fix`, `feat`, `refactor`, `perf`, `chore`, `test`, `docs`
- Scope: use the module name from `lib/app/modules/` (e.g., `auth`, `company`, `job_seeker`, `core`)
- Summary: imperative mood, no period, max 72 characters
- Body: only when the "why" isn't obvious from the summary

Examples:
```
feat(job_seeker): add saved jobs pagination

fix(auth): prevent role mismatch after login with cached session

refactor(core): move StorageService role normalization to helper
```
